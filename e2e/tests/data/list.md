-   The lunatic is on the grass
-   The lunatic is in the hall
    -   Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
    -   Got to keep the loonies on the path

1. The lunatic is in the hall
2. The lunatics are in my hall
    1. The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
    2. And every day the paperboy brings more

-   The lunatic is in my head
-   The lunatic is in my head
    1. You raise the blade
    2. You make the change
        - You rearrange me till I'm sane
        - You lock the door
            1. And throw away the key
            2. And there's someone in my head but it's not me
