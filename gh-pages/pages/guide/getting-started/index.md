# Getting Started

## Overview

Milkdown is a lightweight but powerful WYSIWYG markdown editor. It's made up by two parts:

-   A tiny core which provides plugin loader and kinds of internal plugins.
-   Lots of plugins provide syntax, commands and components.

With this pattern you can enable or disable any custom syntax and feature you like, such as table, latex and slash commands. You can even create your own plugin to support your awesome idea.

## First editor

We have some pieces of code for you to create a very minimal editor:

> **We use [material icon](https://fonts.google.com/icons) and [Roboto Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) in our theme**.
> Make sure to include them for having the best experience.

```typescript
import { Editor } from '@milkdown/core';
import { nord } from '@milkdown/theme-nord';
import { commonmark } from '@milkdown/preset-commonmark';

Editor.make().use(nord).use(commonmark).create();
```

## Taste the plugin

Now let's add an **undo & redo** support for our editor:

```typescript
import { Editor } from '@milkdown/core';
import { nord } from '@milkdown/theme-nord';
import { commonmark } from '@milkdown/preset-commonmark';
import { history } from '@milkdown/plugin-history';

Editor.make().use(nord).use(commonmark).use(history).create();
```

> `Mod` is `Cmd` for mac and `Ctrl` for other platforms.

Now we can undo a edit by using `Mod-z` and redo it by using `Mod-y` or `Shift-Mod-Z`.
