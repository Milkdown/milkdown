# Why Milkdown

There are kinds of different markdown editors, such as [Typora](https://typora.io/), [tui](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor) and [Bear](https://bear.app/).
They work pretty well for writing notes in markdown on different platforms. So why bother making Milkdown?

Milkdown aims to provide a **open source solution** for developers to make their editors more powerful, attractive, and can be used everywhere.

What's more, plugins in prosemirror and remark community can be easily reused to build a Milkdown plugin.

## Themable & Hackable
